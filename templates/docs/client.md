The Client package reduces the work required to communicate with a Mesh server.

If you want a higher-level interface that automatically asserts that server responses
are correct, check out the [Fetcher](/fetcher).

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/coinbase/mesh-sdk-go/client
```

## Examples
Check out the [examples](/examples) to see how easy
it is to connect to a Mesh server.
