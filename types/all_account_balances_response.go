// AllAccountBalancesResponse An AllAccountBalancesResponse is returned on the /account/all-balances
// endpoint. It contains balances for the main account and all associated sub-accounts, along with
// their respective sub-account identifiers and balance types. This response provides all account
// balances in a single request, eliminating the need for multiple calls to /account/balance with
// different sub-account identifiers.
type AllAccountBalancesResponse struct {
	BlockIdentifier *BlockIdentifier `json:"block_identifier"`
	// Array of account balances including main account and all sub-accounts. Each balance includes
	// the sub-account identifier and balance type information.
