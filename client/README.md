[![GoDoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/go.dev-reference-007d9c?logo=go&logoColor=white&style=shield)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/client?tab=doc)

The Client package reduces the work required to communicate with a Rosetta server.

If you want a higher-level interface that automatically asserts that server responses
are correct, check out the [Fetcher](/fetcher).

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/client
```

## Examples
Check out the [examples](/examples) to see how easy
it is to connect to a Rosetta server.
